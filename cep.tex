\section{Introduction}

The \defin{length}, $\ell$, of a path $P:=x_0,\ldots,x_\ell$ is the number of edges in $P$.  For two vertices $x$ and $y$ in a  tree $T$, the \defin{$T$-path}, $\mathdefin{\pth_T(x,y)}$ is the unique path $x_0,\ldots,x_\ell$ in $T$ with $x_0=x$ and $x_\ell=y$. If $Y\subseteq V(T)\setminus\{x\}$ and $T[Y]$ is connected, then $\mathdefin{\pth_T(x,Y)}$ is the shortest path $x_0,\ldots,x_{\ell}$ in $T$ with $x_0=x$ and $x_\ell\in Y$.  For a graph $G$, and two vertices $x$ and $y$ of $G$, $\mathdefin{\dist_G(x,y)}$ is the length of a shortest path, in $G$, with endpoints $x$ and $y$.  For subsets $X$ and $Y$ of $V(G)$, $\mathdefin{\dist_G(X,Y)}:=\min\{\dist_G(x,y):(x,y)\in X\times Y\}$.  For an integer $r\ge 0$ and a vertex $x$ of $G$, $\mathdefin{B_G(x,r)}:=\{y\in V(G):\dist_G(x,y)\le r\}$.  For a subset $S$ of $V(G)$, $\mathdefin{B_G(S,r)}:=\bigcup_{x\in S}B_G(x,r)$, $\mathdefin{\diam_G(S)}:=\max\{\dist_G(x,y):\{x,y\}\in\binom{S}{2}\}$ and $\mathdefin{\radius_G(S)}$ is the minimum integer $r$ such that $S\subseteq B_G(v,r)$ for some $v\in V(G)$.


For any integer $d\ge 0$, let $\mathdefin{\rho_d(G)}$ be the maximum integer $p$ such that $G$ contains cycles $C_1,\ldots,C_p$ such that $\dist_G(V(C_i),V(C_j))\ge d$ for all $1\le i < j\le p$.  We call $\rho_d(G)$ the \defin{distance-$d$ $\rho$acking number} of cycles in $G$.  For any integer $r\ge 0$, a set $X\subseteq V(G)$ is a \defin{radius-$r$ hitting-set} of cycles in $G$ if $G-B_G(X,r)$ is a forest.  Let $\mathdefin{\tau_r(G)}$ be the minimum integer $t$ such that $G$ has a radius-$r$ hitting set.  We call $\tau_r(G)$ the \defin{radius-$r$ hi$\tau\tau$ing-number} of cycles in $G$.  Note that $\tau_r$ and $\rho_d$ are not monotone graph parameters.  If $G'$ is a subgraph of $G$ then a distance-$d$ packing of cycles in $G'$ may not be a distance-$d$ packing of cycles in $G$ since $\dist_{G'}(x,y)\ge \dist_G(x,y)$.  Similarly, a radius-$r$ hitting set $X$ for cycles in $G$ may not be a radius-$r$ hitting set for cycles in $G'$, since $B_{G'}(x,r)\subseteq B_{G}(x,r)$.

\begin{conj}
  There exists functions $f:\N\to\N$ and $g:\N\to\N$ such that, for every graph $G$ and every $d,k\in\N$, $\rho_d(G) \ge k$ or $\tau_{g(d)}(G)\le f(k)$.
\end{conj}


\section{Meat}

\begin{lem}\label{hitting_is_additive}
  Let $G$ be a graph and let $X\subseteq V(G)$.  Then, for any integer $r\ge 0$, $\tau_r(G) \le |X| + \tau_r(G-B_G(X,r))$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $G':=G-B_G(X,r)$.
  Let $Y$ be a radius-$r$ hitting set of cycles in $G'$ with $|Y|=\tau_r(G')$.  Then $G-(B_G(X\cup Y,r))\subseteq (G-B_G(X,r))-B_{G'}(Y,r)$ is a forest, so $\tau_r(G)\le |X\cup Y|\le |X|+\tau_r(G')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{fattening}
  Let $r\ge 1$ be an integer, let $G$ be a graph, let $C_1,\ldots,C_p$ be cycles in $G$ such that $\radius_G(V(C_i))\le r$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$ and $\dist_G(V(C_i),V(C_j)\ge d$ for each distinct $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$, let $X:=\bigcup_{i=1}^p V(C_i)$, and let $G':=G-B_G(X,d)$.  Then $\rho_d(G)\ge p + \rho_d(G')$ and
  $\tau_{d+r}(G) \le p + \tau_{r+d}(G')$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  % Let $G':=G-B_G(X,d)$, so we need to show that $\rho_d(G)\ge p+\rho_d(G')$ and $\tau_{r+d}(G)\le p + \tau_{r+d}(G')$.
  First we show that $\rho_{d}(G)\ge p+\rho_d(G')$.
  Let $A$ be a distance-$d$ packing of cycles in $G'$ of size $\rho_d(G')$.  Since $\dist_G(x,y)\ge d$ for each $x\in X$ and $y\in V(G')$, \dist_G(V(C_i),V(C))\ge d$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$ and each $C\in A$. Therefore, $\{C_1,\ldots,C_p\}\cup A$ is a distance-$d$ packing of cycles in $G$, so $\rho_d(G)\ge p + |A| = p + \rho_d(G')$.

  To see why $\tau_{r+d}(G) \le p + \tau_{r+d}(G')$ holds,  let $X':=\{v_1,\ldots,v_p\}$ be vertices of $G$ such that $V(C_i)\subseteq B_G(v_i,r)$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$.  Observe that $B_G(v_i,r+d)\supseteq B_G(V(C_i),d)$, since $\dist_G(x,V(C_i))\le \dist(x,v_i)+r$ for each $x\in V(G)$.   Therefore $B_G(X',r+d)\supseteq B_G(X,d)$ so $G'':=G-B_G(X',r+d)\subseteq G'$.  Let $Y$ be a radius-$(r+d)$ hitting set for cycles in $G'$ of size $\tau_{r+d}(G')$.  We now argue that $G-B_G(X'\cup Y,r+d)$ is a forest. To see this, let $C$ be a cycle in $G$.  If $C$ is not contained in $G''$ then $C$ contains at least one vertex in $B_G(X',r+d)$, so $C$ is not a cycle in $G-B_G(X'\cup Y,r+d)$.  If $C$ is contained in $G''$ then $C$ is also contained in $G'\supseteq G''$.  Therefore $C$ contains at least one vertex in $B_{G'}(Y,r+d)\subseteq B_G(Y,r+d)$, so $C$ is not a cycle in $G-B_G(X'\cup Y,r+d)$. Therefore  $G-B_G(X'\cup Y,r+d)$ is a forest, so $\tau_{r+d}(G)\le |X'\cup Y| = p+\tau_{r+d}(G')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
  Let $G$ be a graph, let $C$ be a cycle in $G$ and, for each $r\in\N$, let $G_r:=G[B_G(V(C),r)]$.  Then, for any integers $d\ge 0$ and $k\ge 1$, either
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item $G_{2r}$ contains $m\ge \Omega(k/\log k)$ cycles $C_1,\ldots,C_m$ such that $\dist_G(V(C_i),V(C_j))\ge d$ for each distinct $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$; or
    \item there exists $X\subseteq V(C)$ with $|X|\le 2k$ such that $G_{2d}-B_G(X,3d)$ is a forest.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $U$ be a unicyclic subgraph of $G_{2d}$ that spans $V(G_{2d})$, contains every edge of $C$ and for each vertex in $v\in V(G_{2d})\setminus V(C)$ contains exactly one edge $vw$ such that $\dist_G(w,V(C))=\dist_G(v,V(C))-1$.  (Informally, $U$ is obtained from a BFS forest rooted at the vertices of $C$ by adding the edges of $C$.)

  Let $x_0$ be any vertex of $C$ and let $T$ be the tree obtained from $U$ by removing one of the edges of $C$ incident to $x_0$.  For any edge $vw\in E(G_{2d})\setminus E(U)$, consider the subgraph $Q_{vw}$ of $G_{2r}$ formed by taking the union of the edge $vw$, $\pth_T(v,V(C))$, and $\pth_T(w,V(C))$. Then $Q_{vw}$ is either a path with both endpoints in $V(C)$ and no other vertices in $V(C)$ or $Q_{vw}$ is a lollipop whose (possibly $0$-length) handle begin in $V(C)$.\todo{Define lollipop and handle}
  %
  %
  % there is exactly one path $P_{vw}$ in $T-v_0$ with endpoints $v$ and $w$ and $E(P_{vw})\cup\{vw\}$ is the edge set of a cycle $C_{vw}$ in $G_{2d}$. Let $A_{vw}:=E(C_{vw})\setminus E(C)$ and treat $A_{vw}$ as a graph.  Then $A_{vw}$ is a non-empty connected subgraph of $C_{vw}$ having at most $2d$ edges.  Let $B_{vw}:=E(C_{vw})\cap E(C)$.  Treating $B_{vw}$ as a graph, we see that $B_{vw}$ is a connected (possibly null) subgraph of $C$.

  We construct a set $X\subseteq V(G_{2d})$ and a subgraph $Q$ of $G_{2d}$. We begin with $X:=\{x_0\}$ and $Q:=C$.  As long as $G_{2d}-B_G(X,3d)$ contains an edge $vw\not\in E(T)$ such that $V(C_{vw})$ has no vertex in $B_G(X,3d)$, we grow $X$ by adding the at most two vertices $V(Q_{vw})\cap V(C)$ to $X$.  We grow $Q$ by adding $Q_{vw}$ to $Q$.

  Let $k$ be the number of iterations performed by this procedure before stopping.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, let $v_iw_i$ be the edge of $E(G_{2r})\setminus E(T)$ chosen in iteration $i$, let $X_i$ be the set of one or two vertices of $C$ added to $X$ in iteration $i$ and let $Q_i$ be the subgraph added to $Q$ in iteration $i$.  The stopping condition implies that the edges of $G_{2r}-B_G(X,3d)$ are a subset of the edges of $T$, so $G_{2d}-B_G(X,3d)$ is a forest.  All that remains is to show that $G_{2r}$ contains $m\ge \Omega(k\log k)$ cycles $C_1,\ldots,C_m$ such that $\dist_G(V(C_i),V(C_j))\ge d$ for each distinct $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$.

  Observe that, for distinct $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, $\dist_G(X_i,X_j)\ge 3d$, and this implies that $\dist_G(V(Q_i),V(Q_j))\ge d$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, let $C_i$ be the cycle formed by $\pth_T(v_i,w_i)$ and the edge $v_iw_i$.  We will make a collection of cycles $D_1,\ldots,D_m$ in $Q$ with the following properties:
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item The cycles $D_1,\ldots,D_m$ are pairwise vertex-disjoint.
    \item If a cycle $D_i$ uses an edge
  \end{compactitem}







  We distinguish between two cases:  We say that iteration $i$ is \defin{short} if $|V(C_i)\cap V(C)|\le 6d$.  Observe that if iteration $i$ is short, then $\dist_G(C_i,C_j)\ge d$ for all $j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}\setminus\{i\}$.  If the number of short iterations is at least $k/\log k$, then the set of cycles formed by the short iterations satisfies the requirements of the lemma.  We therefore assume that the number of short iterations is at most $k/\log k$.

  Let $I\subseteq \{1,\ldots,k\}$ index only the iterations that are not short.

  Now apply Simonovitz on $Q':=C\cup \bigcup_{i\in\overline{I}} Q_i$ to obtain $\Omega(k/\log k)$ disjoint cycles.  Finally, observe that for any distinct degree-$3$ vertices $x,y\in V(Q')$, $\dist_G(x,y)\ge d$, so the $\rho_d(G_{2d})\ge \Omega(k/\log k)$.
\end{proof}



\begin{lem}
  Let $G$ be a graph and let $P_0,\ldots,P_m$ be subsets of $V(G)$ such that
  $\bigcup_{i=1}^m B_G(P_i,d)=V(G)$ and
  $G[B_G(P_i,2d)]$ is a forest, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$.  Then
\end{lem}





\begin{lem}
  Let $d\ge 1$ be an integer, let $G$ be a graph and let $C$ be a cycle in $G$.  Then $G[B_G(V(C),3d)]$ contains a cycle $C'$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item $G[B_G(V(C'),d)]$ is unicyclic; or
    \item $C'$ has length at most $6d$.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  \todo{This still needs some touching up.}
  Suppose that $C$ has length greater than $6d+2$ and that $G[B_G(V(C),d)]$ is not unicyclic.
  Let $Q_0$ be the shortest cycle in $G[V(C)]$, and let $P_0$ be a $1$-vertex path that contains an arbitrary vertex of $Q_0$.  For $i\ge 1$, suppose that $P_i$ and $Q_i$ are paths with common endpoints, $P_i$ has at most $4d-1$ internal vertices, and that $C_{i-1}:=Q_{i-1}\cup P_{i-1}$ is a cycle that does not satisfy the conditions of the lemma.  At all steps, we will ensure that $Q_i$ is a non-empty path contained in $Q_0$.  Since all the vertices of $Q_0$ are in $V(C)$, these conditions imply that $C_{i-1}$ is contained in $G[B_G(V_C,2d)]$ and $C_{i-1}$ has at most one vertex $v$ such that $\dist_G(v,V(C))=2d$.  Since $C_{i-1}$ does not satisfy the conditions of the lemma, at least one of the following is true:
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item $G[B_G(V(C_{i-1}),d)]$ contains a cycle $C'$ of length at most $6d$; or
    \item $G[B_G(V(C_{i-1}),d)]$ contains a path $P_i'$ with at least $3$ and at most $2d+1$ vertices that has both endpoints in $V(C_{i-1})$ and whose interior is vertex-disjoint from $V(C_{i-1})$.
  \end{compactenum}
  In the first case, the cycle $C'$ satisfies the conditions of the lemma, since $B_G(V(C_{i-1}),d)\subseteq B_G(V(C),3d)$.  Assume that the first case does not apply, so the second case does.  Let $P_i'$ be the shortest path that satisfies the conditions of this second case.  Note that $C_{i-1}\cup P_i'$ is contained in $B_G(V(C_{i-1}),d)\subseteq B_G(V(C),3d)$.   Now there are three possibilities:
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Both endpoints of $P_i'$ are in $V(P_{i-1})$: In this case, $P_i'\cup P_{i-1}$ contains a cycle of length at most $|V(P_{i-1}\cup V(P_i'))|\le 4d-1+2d+1=6d$ which is not possible since the first case above does not apply.
    \item Both endpoints of $P_i'$ are in $V(Q_{i-1})\setminus V(P_{i-i})$.    In this case, we take $C_i$ to be a cycle in $Q_{i-1}\cup P_i'$. This works because $Q_i$ is a non-empty subpath of $Q_{i-1}$ and $P_i:=P_i'$ has at most $|V(P_i')|-2\le 2d-1\le 4d-1$ internal vertices.  Furthermore, $|V(Q_i)|\le |V(Q_{i-1})-2$ because $C_i$ does not contain either endpoint of $Q_{i-1}$.
    \item Exactly one endpoint of $P_i'$ is in $V(P_{i-1})$.  In this case, $C_{i-1}\cup P_i'$ has two cycles that each contain $P_i'$.  One of the at most $4d-1$ internal vertices of $P_{i-1}$ appears in both of these cycles. The other internal vertices $P_{i-1}$ appear in exactly one of these two cycles.  Therefore one of these cycles contains at most $2d$ internal vertices of $P_{i-1}$.  We take $C_i$ to be this cycle and define $P_i$ to be the path in $C_i$ whose endpoints are in $Q_{i-1}$ and whose interior is disjoint from $V(Q_{i-1})$.  Then $P_i$ has at most $2d+2d-1= 4d-1$ internal vertices.  Furthermore $|V(Q_i)|\le |V(Q_{i-1})|-1$ because $C_i$ does not contain one of the endpoints of $Q_{i-1}$.
  \end{compactenum}
  This process eventually produces the desired cycle $C'$ since, at each step in the process $|V(Q_i)|$ decreases.
\end{proof}

\section{Introduction}

For a graph $G$ and a vertex $v\in V(G)$, let $\mathdefin{\deg_G(v)}:=|\{w\in V(G):vw\in E(G)\}|$ be the \defin{degree} of $v$ in $G$.  For each non-negative integer $d$, let $\mathdefin{V_d(G)}:=\{v\in V(G):\deg_G(v)=d\}$.

Let $G$ be a graph and let $F$ be a subgraph of $G$ such that $\deg_F(v)\in\{2,3\}$ for each $v\in V(F)$.  We say that a path $P=p_0,\ldots,p_\ell$ in $G$ is an \defin{extension} of $(G,F)$ if
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
  \item $\deg_F(p_0)=\deg_F(u_\ell)=2$;
  \item $p_1,\ldots,p_m\in V(G)\setminus V(F)$; and
  \item $G[V(P)]=P$ (i.e., $P$ is an induced path in $G$).
\end{compactenum}
In this case, we call $P$ a \defin{$u_0u_m$-extension} of $(G,F)$.
For a positive integer $k$, we say that an extension $P$ of $(G,F)$ is \defin{$k$-bad} if $F\cup P$ contains a cycle $C$ such that
\begin{compactenum}[(b-i)]
  \item $P\subseteq C$;
  \item $|V(C)\cap V_3(F)|\le \log_2 k$; and
  \item $G[V(C)]$ is chordal.
\end{compactenum}
We say that $C$ \defin{witnesses} the fact that $P$ is $k$-bad.
If $P$ is not $k$-bad, then $P$ is \defin{$k$-good}.


A graph is \defin{outerplanar} if it has a planar drawing in which all vertices appear on a single face.  If this face is unique, we call it the \defin{outer face}.

\begin{obs}\label{hamiltonian}
  If $H$ is Hamiltonian chordal graph with at least $3$ vertices then, for any Hamiltonian cycle $C$ of $H$, $H$ contains an edge-maximal outerplanar graph $H'$ whose outer face is $C$.
\end{obs}

A \defin{chord} of a cycle $C$ in a graph $G$ is an edge $vw\in E(G)$ such that $v,w\in V(C)$ but $vw\not\in E(C)$.  $C$ is \defin{chord-free} if has no chord.  A \defin{hole} in $G$ is a chord-free cycle with at least four vertices. $G$ is \defin{chordal} if it has no holes.

Consider the following construction of graphs $F_0,\ldots,F_r\subseteq G$, where $G$ is a non-chordal graph:  Let $F_0$ be a minimum-size hole in $G$. For $i\ge 1$, if all extensions of $(G,F_{i-1})$ are $k$-bad, then $r:=i-1$ and we are done.  Otherwise, let $P_i$ be a good extension of $(G,F_{i-1})$ of minimum size and set $F_i:=F_{i-1}\cup P_i$.

Note that in the following lemma, there can be vertices $v,w\in V_2(F)$, that have no $vw$-extension of $(G,F_r)$.  This happens when $v$ and $w$ are in different components of $G-(V(F)\setminus\{v,w\})$.

\begin{lem}\label{coolio}
  For each distinct $v,w\in V_2(F_{r})$, and each $vw$-extension $P$ of $F_r$, there exists a cycle $C$ in $F_r\cup P$ that witnesses the fact that $P$ is bad and such that $G[V(C)]$ contains an edge-maximal outerplanar graph $H$ whose outer face is $C$ and such that $V_2(H)=\{v,w\}$.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}


\begin{proof}
  Let $P:=p_0,\ldots,p_\ell$ be a $vw$-extension of $(G,F_r)$.  Since the construction of $F_r$ stopped at iteration $r+1$, $P$ is a bad extension of $(G,F_r)$.  Let $C$ be the minimum-length cycle that witnesses the fact that $P$ is $k$-bad.  By \cref{hamiltonian} $G[V(C)]$ contains an edge-maximal outerplanar graph $H$ whose outer face is $C$.  Since $P$ is an induced path in $G$ and $H$ is edge-maximal outerplanar, $\deg_{H}({p_i})\neq 2$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,\ell-1\}$.  Let $Q:=q_0,\ldots,q_m=C-\{p_1,\ldots,p_{\ell-1}\}$.  Since $C$ has minimum length, $Q$ is an induced path in $G[V(F_r)]$.  Again, this implies that $\deg_{H}(q_i)}\neq 2$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m-1\}$.  Therefore $V_2(H)=\{p_0,q_0,p_\ell,q_m\}=\{v,w\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
  Let $P:=p_0,\lots,p_\ell$ be an induced path in $G$ that starts at $p_0\in V_2(F_r)$ in the interior of some extension $P_i$, ends at some vertex $p_\ell\in V_2(F_r)$ in the interior of some extension $P_j$ for some $i\neq j$, and has no interior vertices in $V(F_r)$.  Then, for some $x\in\{1,\ldots,\ell-1\}$,  $N_G(x)$ contains a vertex in $V(P_i)\cap V_3(F_r)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Consider the cycle $C$ and the edge-maximal outerplanar graph $H$ guaranteed by \cref{coolio}.  Then $Q:=C-\{p_1,\ldots,p_{\ell-1}\}$ is a path in $F_r$ with endpoints $p_0$ and $p_\ell$.  Therefore $Q$ contains a degree-$3$ vertex $w$ of $P_i$.  Since $p_0,p_\ell\in V_2(F_r)$,  $w\not\in \{p_0,p_{\ell}\}$.  Therefore $\deg_H(w)\ge 3$,  which implies that $w$ is adjacent, in $G$, to some vertex in the interior of $P$.
\end{proof}
